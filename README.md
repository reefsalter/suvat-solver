## Overview

The SUVAT Solver is a web-based tool that calculates and solves problems related to motion and displacement using the SUVAT equations. These equations describe the relationships between initial velocity (u), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), time (t), and displacement (s) in kinematics.

This tool is designed to help students, educators, and anyone interested in physics to quickly and easily calculate unknown values in motion problems. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can input known values, and it will calculate the missing parameters.

## Features

- Solve for any of the five SUVAT variables (s, u, v, a, t) given the other four.
- Support for various combinations of known values.
- Units displayed in the results (e.g., m, m/s, m/s², s).
- Export the solved results as an image.
- Watermark with copyright and website URL on the exported image.

## Usage

1. Open the SUVAT Solver in your web browser.
2. Enter known values for any three of the five SUVAT variables.
3. Click the "Solve" button to calculate the missing values.
4. Optionally, click the "Export as Image" button to save the results as an image.
